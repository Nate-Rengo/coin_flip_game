# Coin Flip and Dice Roll Game

## Description
This project is a **Coin Flip and Dice Roll Game** developed in **Java** with an **SQLite database** for data storage. It was completed by a team of two as the final project for a **Software Engineering course**. The game allows multiple users to intereact at the same time with the server and to create accounts, log in, and place bets on two types of games:

- **Coin Flip**: Players can bet on heads or tails.
- **Dice Roll**: Players can bet on a number a dice will land on.

Users can enter their bet amount, and their account keeps track of their earnings as they play. 

The project follows **Agile development** principles with multiple sprints, focusing on iterating through game features and user interaction.
